## 🧠 Example Lab – GuardDuty Threat Detection
**Objective:** Detect and analyze threats in an AWS environment.  
**Steps:**
1. Enabled GuardDuty across 3 regions.
2. Simulated reconnaissance attack (port scan).
3. Integrated findings into Security Hub.
4. Created Lambda function for auto-response (block offending IP).

**Key Takeaway:** Learned how to automate real-time threat detection and mitigation using native AWS services.
